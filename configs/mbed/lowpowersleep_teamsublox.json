    "description": "This class provides an API to assist with low power behaviour on an STM32F437 micro, as used on the u-blox C030 board. If you need to operate from battery for any significant period, or are mains powered and don't want to take the planet down with you, you should design your code with this in mind. This library uses the https://developer.mbed.org/users/Sissors/code/WakeUp/ library and so could be extended to support all of the MCUs that library supports.",
