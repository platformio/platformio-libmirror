    "description": "The INA219 is a high-side current shunt and power monitor with an I2C interface. The INA219 monitors both shunt drop and supply voltage, with programmable conversion times and filtering. A programmable calibration value, combined with an internal multiplier, enables direct readouts in amperes. An additional multiplying register calculates power in watts. The I2C interface features 16 programmable addresses.",
