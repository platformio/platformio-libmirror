    "description": "This class provides an API to communicate with a u-blox GNSS chip. The files here were originally part of the C027_Support library (https://developer.mbed.org/teams/ublox/code/C027_Support/ at revision 138:dafbbf31bf76) but have been separated out, primarily for use on the u-blox C030 board where the cellular interace portion of the C027_Support library will instead be provided through the new mbed Cellular API.",
