    "description": "This library is designed to work with devices like the LM335 temperature sensor. There are only two requirements for compatibility: 1) The device must be a sensor device that has an analog voltage output. 2) The physical quantity measured must vary linearly with the analog voltage. It uses a median filter to remove unwanted noise from ADC readings. The number of samples in the filter can be specified as an argument, as well as calibration points or a linear multiplier and coefficient.",
