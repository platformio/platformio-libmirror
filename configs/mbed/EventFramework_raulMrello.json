    "description": "EventFramework library allows the creation of an event-driven infrastructure in which small \"threads\" can handle events in a multithreaded execution context. The EventFramework can be configured to act as a cooperative or a fully-preemptive kernel with fixed-priority scheduling. Furthermore, this kernel matches run-to-completion semantics, and hence a single-stack configuration is enough to keep running this multithreaded execution environment. As running threads shares global stack, a huge quantity of RAM is saved in contrast with traditional RTOSes.",
