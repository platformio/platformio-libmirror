    "description": "This is a driver code for the PCA9632 is an I2C-bus controlled 4-bit LED driver optimized for Red/Green/Blue/Amber (RGBA) color mixing applications. In Individual brightness control mode, each LED output has its own 8-bit resolution (256 steps) fixed frequency Individual PWM controller that operates at 1.5625 kHz with a duty cycle that is adjustable from 0 % to 99.6 % to allow the LED to be set to a specific brightness value.",
