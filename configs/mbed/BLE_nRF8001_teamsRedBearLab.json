    "description": "It is the Nordic nRF8001 BLE library for RedBearLab BLE Shield v2.1 or above. It is compatible with the platforms those soldered Arduino compatible form factor. The library is ported to mbed from Sandeep's arduino-BLEPeripheral library for Arduino: https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-BLEPeripheral. We have tested it on KL05, KL25, MK20 and SeeedStudio Arch platforms and it works well.",
