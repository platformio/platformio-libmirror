    "description": "Implementation of the CellularInterface for u-blox C027 and C030 (non-N2xx flavour) modems that uses the IP stack on-board the cellular modem, hence not requiring LWIP (and so less RAM) and allowing any AT command exchanges to be carried out at the same time as data transfers (since the modem remains in AT mode all the time). This library may be used from mbed 5.5 onwards. If you need to use SMS, USSD or access the modem file system at the same time as using the CellularInterface then use ublox-at-cellular-interface-ext instead.",
