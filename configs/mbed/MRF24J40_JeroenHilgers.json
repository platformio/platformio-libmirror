    "description": "This library lets you connect an MRF24J40 tranceiver to your mbed. The MRF24J40 is intended for use as a zigbee tranceiver. However, it can also be used to simply send data from one tranceiver to another. The tranceiver is also available as a module on a small PCB with antenna etc. It requires no other components and can be connected to the mbed using 5 pins.",
