    "description": "The IrcBot class can connect to a channel on an IRC network. Users on the same network can send messages to the bot that are parsed by message handlers. The included handlers read digital/analog inputs and write digital outputs or echo messages back to the command sender/channel. Users can write their own message handlers inheriting from the MessageHandler class to perform different actions.",
