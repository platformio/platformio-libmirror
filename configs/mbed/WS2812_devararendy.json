    "description": "This is a bitbang library for WS2812. I test it with STM32F411RE (Nucleo 441RE). If you want to use another board, u need to adjust the sum of asm(\"nop\"). In the example program i put some code to measure how many asm(\"nop\") do we need. See more detail about WS2812 timing https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2812.pdf",
